# ReX-QuantumBot-Core
This is the back-end component of ReX, an AI coach who serves as a steadfast career companion for learners, developed during my Radical AI internship. Individuals and teams face the challenge of staying in sync and maintaining productivity. QuantumBot addresses this problem by providing a platform for continuous dialogue, critical for the success of collaborative endeavors. Node.js, Firebase Firestore, and Postman API were used to develop and store unique features, such as chat history.
